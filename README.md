A simple TUI block pushing game.

## 1. Introduction ðŸ¤”

This game was first written in C in my freshman year (2020).

Recently, in order to backup my pre-github projects, I dug it out again. But besides puting the original one in my repo, I also decided to rewrite it in Go to get more familiar with the language.

### Why Catherine? 

Well, obviously itâ€™s named after the game _Catherine_ (Atlus, 2011), and even the name of the hero and the background story are same as its. 

This is mainly because _Catherine_ is the first game I can call to mind when thinking about block pushing game (though I wrote the game in plain TUI 2D).

## 2. Build & Run ðŸ› 

The build scripts of both versions are written in Makefile.
