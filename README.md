A simple TUI block-pushing game.

## 1. Introduction 🤔

This game was first written in C in my freshman year (2020).

Recently, to back up my pre-GitHub projects, I dug it out again. But besides putting the original one in my repo, I also decided to rewrite it in Go to get more familiar with the language.

### Why Catherine? 

Well, it’s named after the game *Catherine* (Atlus, 2011), and even the name of the hero and the background story of mine are the same as its. 

This is mainly because *Catherine* is the first game I can call to mind when thinking about a block-pushing game (though I wrote the game in plain TUI 2D).

## 2. Build & Run 🛠

The build scripts of both versions are written in Makefile.
